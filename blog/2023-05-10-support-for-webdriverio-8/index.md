![WebdriverIO Roboter](./webdriverio-roboter.png)

Serenity/JS started to support WebdriverIO in version 2.30.0. 

In version 3.0.0, Serenity/JS brought you [`@serenity-js/web`](/handbook/web-testing/) - a portable abstraction
layer that lets you run the exact same web scenario with [WebdriverIO](/api/webdriverio), [Playwright](/api/playwright), and even [Protractor](/api/protractor)!

Now, we're taking things further with [**Serenity/JS 3.2.0**](/changelog/3.2.0) introducing support for the latest and greatest **WebdriverIO 8**! ðŸ¥³ 

Check out our new tutorial where in **less than 5 minutes**, you'll learn how to **integrate Serenity/JS** with your WebdriverIO test suite, **enable Serenity BDD reports**, and start using the **Screenplay Pattern**!
