We‚Äôre thrilled to announce the release of Serenity/JS 3.31, marking a significant step forward for modern test automation.
This release introduces support for **WebdriverIO 9**,
while maintaining compatibility with **WebdriverIO 8** for projects that are not yet ready to migrate ([#2572](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues/2572)).

Let‚Äôs explore what makes this update exciting!

## New in Serenity/JS 3.31

### Support for WebdriverIO 9

The most notable new feature introduced by [WebdriverIO 9](https://webdriver.io/blog/2024/08/15/webdriverio-v9-release/) is support for the **WebDriver BiDi protocol**.
This new protocol enables modern test automation capabilities like network request mocking and console log inspection,
which will be progressively supported with dedicated Screenplay Pattern interactions in upcoming Serenity/JS releases.

Thanks to Serenity/JS being an [abstraction over WebdriverIO](/handbook/architecture/) (and other [web integration tools](/api/web/)), upgrading to WebdriverIO 9 should require only a few simple configuration updates
to replace the deprecated configuration properties.
In most cases, no changes to test code are needed helping your team stay up-to-date with your tools while minimising the maintenance cost of your Serenity/JS-based frameworks.

We owe special thanks to [Christian Bromann](https://github.com/christian-bromann), Head of the WebdriverIO project, for supporting us in integrating Serenity/JS with this new release.

Thank you, Christian!

### Continued support for WebdriverIO 8

Serenity/JS continues to support WebdriverIO 8 via the new [`@serenity-js/webdriverio-8`](/api/webdriverio-8/) module, offering stability for teams not yet ready to upgrade.
This ensures smooth transition without compromising existing projects.

### Brand new WebdriverIO guide

We've revised, simplified, and updated the [Serenity/JS WebdriverIO integration guide](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/) to reflect the latest changes, making it easier for you to get started with Serenity/JS and WebdriverIO 9.

### Updated WebdriverIO Project Templates

[Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/project-templates/) now default to WebdriverIO 9, making it easy for new projects to start with the latest features.

## Upgrading to Serenity/JS 3.31

To upgrade your existing project to **Serenity/JS 3.31** and **WebdriverIO 9**, follow our new [WebdriverIO 9 upgrade guide](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/#upgrading-to-webdriverio-9).

If you'd like to upgrade Serenity/JS but keep using **WebdriverIO 8**, follow these steps:
- install the `@serenity-js/webdriverio-8` module instead of `@serenity-js/webdriverio`,
- replace any imports of `@serenity-js/webdriverio` with `@serenity-js/webdriverio-8`.

## Your feedback matters!

I hope this latest release of Serenity/JS will make it even easier for you and your team to create high-quality test automation.
