Love numbers? You'll love Serenity/JS 3.29! üéâ

We‚Äôre excited to share the latest release of Serenity/JS, which is packed with new powerful features for handling numeric data in your automated tests!



## New to Serenity/JS?

Serenity/JS web testing tutorial was called "the best guide if you want to take your automation skills to the next level." ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you're new to Serenity/JS or web automation in general, start with ["Your first web scenario"](/handbook/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/).

## New in Serenity/JS 3.29

### Built-in support for arithmetic operations

Part of the [Serenity/JS Core module](/api/core/), the new [`Numeric`](/api/core/class/Numeric/) class offers built-in support for performing arithmetic operations
on both synchronous and asynchronous data types directly within your Serenity/JS test scenarios.

In addition, this new class offers methods to help you extract numeric data from REST API responses and web interfaces
and convert it to a desired numeric data type without any external libraries or complex workarounds.

This enhancement makes your tests more readable, reduces the risk of calculation errors, and ensures data-driven scenarios are both easy to implement and maintain.
With `Numeric`, your test logic is cleaner, making Serenity/JS even more developer-friendly.

Learn about [`Numeric`](/api/core/class/Numeric/).


### More Serenity/JS examples in your IDE!

We continue our effort to bring the thousands of examples available in the [Serenity/JS API documentation](/api/) close to you and your team.
As part of that, the new [`Numeric`](/api/core/class/Numeric/) class ships with **15 new examples**, demonstrating how to extract numeric data from user interfaces and data objects.
You'll also learn how to use the new features with [Serenity/JS Page Element Query Language](/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/) to make extracting the right UI element even easier!

Check out the Serenity/JS API docs at https://serenity-js.org/api/

Enjoy Serenity!
