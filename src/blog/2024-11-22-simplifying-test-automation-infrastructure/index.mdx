## New in Serenity/JS 3.30

### Streamlined Serenity BDD Installation

One of the most exciting additions in this release is the inclusion of the Serenity BDD CLI jar file directly within the `@serenity-js/serenity-bdd` Node module.
This improvement eliminates the need for a separate download, helps to simplify the installation process, and reduces friction for teams getting started with Serenity/JS
([#2560](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues/2560)).

We owe special thanks to [Anton Fedorov](https://github.com/fapspirit) from Amazon Web Services for proposing this feature
and contributing its implementation. Anton‚Äôs work is a fantastic example of the open-source spirit driving Serenity/JS forward.

Thank you, Anton!

### Improved support for private and Node-only artifact registries

Serenity/JS has always supported private artifact registries like Sonatype Nexus or JFrog Artifactory.
However, corporate proxies and network constraints could sometimes
make the [setup process](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#using-a-custom-serenity-bdd-cli) a bit more complex than we would have liked.

Serenity/JS 3.30 includes the Serenity BDD CLI jar directly in the `@serenity-js/serenity-bdd` Node module.
This change simplifies your infrastructure by letting you use a single registry for both Node modules and the Serenity BDD CLI jar
and enables support for Node-only artifact registries like [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/).

### Playwright 1.49 compatibility

Keeping Serenity/JS at the cutting edge of browser automation, this release introduces support for Playwright 1.49.
With it, you can leverage the latest advancements in browser automation across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Additionally, Playwright 1.49 brings improved handling and more accurate reporting on nested errors ([playwright#26848](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/26848)),
making it easier to diagnose issues with custom Serenity/JS configuration ([#1823](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues/1823)).

### Updated Serenity/JS Project Templates

Getting started with Serenity/JS has never been easier! The [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/project-templates/) have been updated
to reflect the latest improvements, helping you kickstart your projects with best practices built right in.

## Upgrading to Serenity/JS 3.30

To upgrade your existing project to Serenity/JS 3.30, use a tool like [`npm-check-updates`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates):

```sh
npx -y npm-check-updates '/@serenity-js|playwright/' -u
```

Next, remove the call to `serenity-bdd update` from your `package.json` file:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-   "postinstall": "serenity-bdd update",
    "clean": "rimraf target",
    "test": "failsafe clean test:execute test:report",
    "test:execute": "playwright test",
    "test:report": "serenity-bdd run"
  }
}
```

Finally, install the updated modules:

```npm2yarn
npm install
```

## Your feedback matters!

I hope this latest release of Serenity/JS will make it even easier for you and your team to create high-quality test automation.
