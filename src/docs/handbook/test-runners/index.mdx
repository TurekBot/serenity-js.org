# Test Runners

**Serenity/JS Test Runner Adapters** are the main integration point between your test runner and Serenity/JS.

Adapters interpret internal test runner events, translate them to [Serenity/JS domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events),
and enable [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting) even if your test scenarios don't follow
the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) yet.

Some of the adapters can also help you pre-configure Serenity/JS to use a default [cast of actors](/api/core/class/Cast)
appropriate for the kind of test automation you're doing,
and make it easier for your team to adopt [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern APIs](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern).

In this part of the Serenity/JS Handbook, you'll learn how to integrate Serenity/JS with the following test runners:
- [Cucumber](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber)
- [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine)
- [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha)
- [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test)
- [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor)
- [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio)
