# Serenity/JS Installation Guide

Serenity/JS integrates your favourite automation tools into a cohesive platform
and gives you a consistent [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/)-based API to implement multi-actor,
multi-interface test scenarios and generate rich, illustrated reports.

This guide helps you install the core runtime dependencies and prepare your development environment for writing and running Serenity/JS test scenarios.
Once you have the development environment set up, follow your test runner's [dedicated configuration guide](/handbook/test-runners/)
to create a new project or add Serenity/JS to your existing codebase.

## Quick start ðŸš€

To start testing immediately, consider using:
- [**Serenity/JS Project Templates**](/handbook/project-templates/) - pre-configured with essential dependencies
- [**Serenity/JS GitPods**](/handbook/project-templates/#serenityjs-gitpods) - ready-to-use cloud-based environments

## Installing Node.js

Serenity/JS runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and supports recent [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) versions.
It is tested with Node.js <SupportedNodeVersions conjunction="and" />.

### Downloading Node.js

To install Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm):
- **Recommended**: Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Advanced**: Use [Node Version Manager (nvm)](http://nvm.sh) to manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single machine

### Verifying the installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node --version
```

Expected output (example):

<CodeBlock language="bash" >
    <CurrentNodeVersion />
</CodeBlock>

## Installing the JRE

Serenity/JS uses [Serenity BDD](http://serenity-bdd.info/) to generate the illustrated HTML reports.
Serenity BDD is a Java library and requires the [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) **version 17** or newer.

### Downloading JRE

To install the JRE:
- **Recommended**: Download the installer from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- **Advanced**: Use the [Software Development Kit Manager (SDKMan)](https://sdkman.io/) to manage multiple Java versions on a single machine

### Verifying the installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
java -version
```

Expected output (example):
```shell
openjdk version "22" 2024-03-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-22.0.0.36.2 (build 22+36-FR)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-22.0.0.36.2 (build 22+36-FR, mixed mode, sharing)
```

If you use multiple Java versions, ensure `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the correct one. On macOS, it could be:

```shell
echo $JAVA_HOME
/Users/jan/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
```

## Installing an IDE

Serenity/JS supports open standards and works with all the popular JavaScript and TypeScript editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

Learn more about Serenity/JS integration with your favourite IDE:

- [JetBrains IDEA](/handbook/integration/jetbrains-idea/)
- [VisualStudio Code](/handbook/integration/visual-studio-code/)

## Setting up CI/CD integration

Serenity/JS is designed to work with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) systems.

Learn how to configure Serenity/JS with your CI/CD system of choice:

- [GitLab CI](/handbook/integration/gitlab-ci/)
- [GitHub Actions](/handbook/integration/github-actions/)
- [Jenkins CI](/handbook/integration/jenkins-ci/)
