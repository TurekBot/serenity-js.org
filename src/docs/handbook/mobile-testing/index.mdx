# Mobile testing with Serenity/JS

Serenity/JS integrates with [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio) to provide reporting capabilities for native mobile tests using the [Appium](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/appium/) protocol.

We're currently working on providing Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern libraries to support native mobile testing, so follow feature request [#1279 on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues/1279) to stay up to date with the progress
and consider [sponsoring Serenity/JS](https://github.com/sponsors/serenity-js) to help us prioritise the development of this feature.
