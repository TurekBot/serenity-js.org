# Tutorials

**Serenity/JS Tutorials** offer a carefully curated collection of hands-on guides designed to immerse you in the Serenity/JS framework.
These tutorials enable you to develop real-world test scenarios without needing to set anything up locally - unless you choose to.

With each tutorial, you'll embark on a practical journey through the framework, discovering how to extend the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/project-templates/) to solve real-world test automation challenges.
As you progress, you'll see how the different Serenity/JS modules come together to help you write clearer, more maintainable tests. And if you'd like to explore further, I'll point you to guides that dive into each topic in greater detail.

**What you'll learn:**
- [Your First Web Scenario](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario/) – Write and run your first web test using the Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern, featuring built-in debugging support and structured test design.
- [Your First API Test Scenario](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-api-scenario/) – Automate the testing of RESTful APIs with Serenity/JS.
- [Upgrading from Serenity/JS 2](/handbook/tutorials/upgrading-from-serenity-js-2/) – Explore what's new in Serenity/JS 3 and learn how to upgrade your existing Serenity/JS 2 projects.
