**Serenity/JS** is an open-source test automation framework that transforms acceptance testing into a **collaborative**, **intuitive**, and **enjoyable experience** for everyone on your team!
By leveraging the Screenplay Pattern, Serenity/JS unifies developers, testers, and business stakeholders and helps your team create high-quality,
reliable test scenarios that align with real-world workflows and deliver meaningful insights.

This **Serenity/JS Handbook** offers plenty of practical examples, exercises, and reference implementations to help you get started with Serenity/JS and succeed with modern test automation.


## Why choose Serenity/JS

Serenity/JS revolutionises how teams approach test automation:

- **For Developers:** Modular APIs and vendor-agnostic design allow you to write clean, reusable code that integrates seamlessly with your existing Node.js toolchain.
- **For Testers:** Simulate authentic multi-actor workflows spanning web UIs, REST APIs, mobile apps, and more.
- **For Business Stakeholders:** Benefit from clear, actionable reports and living documentation that connect technical outcomes to meaningful business insights.


### Improved collaboration

- **Speak the same language**: The [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) fosters alignment between
  developers, testers, and business stakeholders by helping you develop a test language that captures your domain vocabulary and workflows.
  No matter your role, you'll find it easy to stay aligned and contribute meaningfully to the testing process.

- **Focus on actors**: Serenity/JS test scenarios are written from the perspective of [actors](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#actors) interacting
  with your system, ensuring clarity and relevance to real-world workflows.


### Reusable and modular design

- **Write once, reuse anywhere**: Serenity/JS APIs encourage your team to craft modular,
  reusable code modelled after the various activities performed by your actors.
  Combine activities into [reusable tasks](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#tasks) and
  easily represent even the most complex multi-actor and multi-interface scenarios.

- **Scale effortlessly**: Serenity/JS's actor-centric design minimises redundancy and helps you keep your tests maintainable.
  It also enables you to build **reusable automation libraries** that can be shared across projects and teams to create
  a **cohesive testing ecosystem** across your organisation and scale your automation as your systems evolve.

- **Encourage portability**: The Serenity/JS Web module provides a portable abstraction layer over popular automation
  tools like Selenium, Playwright, and WebdriverIO.
  This abstraction makes your test code vendor-agnostic, enabling you to switch or mix underlying tools without rewriting your tests. For example:
  - You could reuse the test code between your UI component tests using the Playwright Component Test runner and your end-to-end (E2E)
    test scenarios running with WebdriverIO against a remote Selenium WebDriver grid.
  - Similarly, you could quickly adapt tests developed with one integration tool to use another.
    This portability not only future-proofs your test automation but also allows you to leverage the strengths of different tools depending on the context - whether it's local development, CI pipelines, or cross-browser testing.


### Realistic multi-actor scenarios

- **Test across interfaces**: Test across web UIs, REST APIs, mobile apps, and more - all within a single framework and using the same consistent design patterns.

- **Achieve true end-to-end coverage**: Simulate realistic multi-actor user journeys across all touchpoints, ensuring comprehensive feature coverage.


### Continuous automation

- **CI/CD-ready**: Serenity/JS supports Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, and Continuous Delivery paradigms, ensuring your automated tests are as easy to run on your machine as they are as part of your [test automation pipelines](/handbook/integration/).

- **Efficient execution**: Execute tests in parallel or sharded, locally or remotely, and integrate with your favourite CI/CD tools to support your team and ensure your system is always release-ready.


### Insightful reporting

- Generate [**world-class test reports** and **living documentation**](/handbook/reporting/) that connect test outcomes to business requirements.

- Provide stakeholders with **clear, actionable insights** into your system's performance, stability, and release readiness.
