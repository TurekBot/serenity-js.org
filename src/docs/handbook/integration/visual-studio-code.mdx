# Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor that comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.
It also has a [rich ecosystem of extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) to help you with your development tasks, such as running and debugging tests.

Serenity/JS integrates with [industry-standard test runners](/handbook/test-runners/) using their dedicated integration protocols,
which means that to run and debug your Serenity/JS tests in Visual Studio Code you simply need the appropriate extension for your test runner of choice.
