# JetBrains IDEA

[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) <abbr title="Integrated Development Environments">IDEs</abbr> are popular among developers for their powerful features and support for a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.
They provide a rich set of tools for code editing, refactoring, debugging, and testing, making them a top choice for many software development teams.

Serenity/JS integrates with [industry-standard test runners](/handbook/test-runners/) using their dedicated integration protocols,
which means that to run and debug your Serenity/JS tests in JetBrain IDEs you simply need the appropriate extension for your test runner of choice.
