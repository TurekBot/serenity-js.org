# Data structures

All the [activities](/api/core/class/Activity) performed by Serenity/JS actors are asynchronous,
and so are the data structures that support them.
Serenity/JS introduces several **async-first, dynamic abstractions** around the native JavaScript
[data structures and data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) to support writing
test scenarios following the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern).

In this article, I'll show you how the below idiomatic Serenity/JS data structures work and how to use them in your scenarios:
- [`Question`](/api/core/class/Question)
- [`QuestionAdapter`](/api/core#QuestionAdapter)
- [`Answerable`](/api/core/#Answerable)
- [`MetaQuestion`](/api/core/interface/MetaQuestion/)
- [`List`](/api/core/class/List)
- [`Notes`](/api/core/function/notes)
