# Installation

```mdx-code-block
import SupportedNodeVersions from '@site/src/components/SupportedNodeVersions'
import CurrentNodeVersion from '@site/src/components/CurrentNodeVersion'
```

In this article, you'll learn how to:
- create a Node.js project capable of running Serenity/JS test scenarios
- install runtime dependencies required to create automated tests based on Serenity/JS
- configure TypeScript (if you'd like to)
- install Serenity/JS modules

:::info Getting started with Serenity/JS
With Serenity/JS, you don't need to start from scratch!
**Serenity/JS GitPods** and **Serenity/JS Project Templates** come with appropriate Serenity/JS modules and lower-level integration and test tools already configured.

Learn more about faster ways of [getting started with Serenity/JS](/handbook/getting-started).
:::

## Installing Node.js

Serenity/JS is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) program. To help you ensure maximum stability of your test scenarios,
Serenity/JS relies on a recent [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) version of the [Node.js platform](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can get both Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm) either from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) website,
which provides convenient installers for all the major operating systems, or using the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](http://nvm.sh).
The second option is more appropriate if you need to work with several versions of the Node.js platform simultaneously.

To check if your machine is set up correctly, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node --version
```

The version number returned by the above command should be a recent version of Node <SupportedNodeVersions conjunction="or" />.
For example, Node <CurrentNodeVersion />.

## Installing Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

Serenity/JS delegates the work of generating the illustrated HTML reports to [Serenity BDD](http://serenity-bdd.info/),
which is a Java library and therefore requires
a [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) **version 8** or newer.

You can download the JRE from [oracle.com](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html),
[adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/),
or by using the excellent [Software Development Kit Manager (SDKMan)](https://sdkman.io/)

To verify that you have the JRE installed, execute the below command in your terminal:

```shell
java -version
```
The output should look similar to the following:
```shell
java version "1.8.0_181"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)
```

If you're working with several versions of the Java platform simultaneously, please make sure that you point
your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable at the correct version.

On macOS this could be:

```shell
echo $JAVA_HOME
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Please consult the [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E21454_01/html/821-2532/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t.html)
for more details.

## Creating a Node.js project

Serenity/JS is typically installed as a [dev dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#devdependencies)
of a [Node.js project](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).
This way it doesn't accidentally get bundled together with your production dependencies.

If you're introducing Serenity/JS to an existing project you can skip this section as its purpose is to help you
create `package.json` - a Node.js project descriptor file, which would already be part of your project.

To create a Node.js project from scratch, create a new directory, such as `serenity-js-example`.
Next, initialise a new Node.js project accepting the default configuration suggested by the npm with these terminal commands:

```shell
mkdir serenity-js-example
cd serenity-js-example
npm init
```

Your actions should result in a basic [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)
file appearing under `serenity-js-example`, with contents similar to the following:

```json title="serenity-js-example/package.json"
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Installing a web browser

If you're planning to make your acceptance tests interact with a web interface, you'll need a web browser.
The way you install web browsers and their associated drivers depends on whether you want to use [Playwright](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test)
or a [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev)-based integration library, such as [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio) or [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor).

### Using Playwright

For test suites using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), install `playwright` module, as well as its browsers and operating system-level dependencies
by running the below commands in your terminal:

```shell title="serenity-js-example/"
npm install --save-dev playwright
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

Learn more about the [installing Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#introduction).

### Using Selenium Webdriver

For test suites using the Selenium Webdriver protocol via [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio) or [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor),
you'll need to install the appropriate web browsers and their [associated drivers](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) on any machine running the tests.

If you already have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed locally,
you can add its [driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver) to your Node project by running the following command in your terminal:
```shell title="serenity-js-example/"
npm install --save-dev chromedriver
```

Consult the Selenium project documentation to learn [how to install other drivers](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/).

## Using TypeScript

Serenity/JS is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and offers first-class support for TypeScript projects.

To use TypeScript in your project, install the following dependencies:

```shell title="serenity-js-example/"
npm install typescript @types/node ts-node
```

Next, create a [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) file in your project root directory:

```json title="serenity-js-example/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2019",
    "lib": ["es2019", "dom"],
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "types": [
      "node"
    ]
  },

  "include": [
    "features/**/*.ts",
    "test/**/*.ts"
  ],

  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

Make sure to configure the [`include`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include) property to cover all your
testing-related TypeScript sources.

## Installing Serenity/JS modules

All the official [Serenity/JS modules](/handbook/about/architecture) are distributed
via the Node Package Manager registry at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40serenity-js)
and published under the [`@serenity-js/`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40serenity-js) namespace.

Each [Serenity/JS module](/api) provides detailed installation instructions, and you can install them from your computer
terminal by running:

```text
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/core
```

You can also install several Serenity/JS modules simultaneously:

```text
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/{assertions,console-reporter,core,rest,serenity-bdd}
```

:::info Stay up to date
Please make sure to always update your Serenity/JS dependencies together and use the same version number for all the `@serenity-js/*` modules you depend on.
Learn more about [versioning](/handbook/about/versioning).
:::

If your machine is part of a corporate network and doesn't have direct access to npmjs.com, you should be able to download
Serenity/JS (and other publicly available Node modules) from your company internal artifact registry:
- [Using NPM with JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/npm+Registry)
- [Using NPM with Sonatype Nexus](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/npm-registry/configuring-npm)
