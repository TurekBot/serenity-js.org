- Why the [modular architecture](/handbook/about/architecture) of Serenity/JS is beneficial for test automation frameworks you build on top of it
- How [Serenity/JS semantic versioning](/handbook/about/versioning) works and how to stay up to date with the latest features and bug fixes
- [What's changed in Serenity/JS v3](/handbook/about/serenity-js-v3) compared to v2
