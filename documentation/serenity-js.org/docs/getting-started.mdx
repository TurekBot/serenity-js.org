# Getting started

```mdx-code-block
import SupportedNodeVersions from '@site/src/components/SupportedNodeVersions'
import CurrentNodeVersion from '@site/src/components/CurrentNodeVersion'
```

In this article, you'll learn how:
- [**Serenity/JS Gitpods**](#serenityjs-gitpods) let you experience the framework in your web browser _right now_, no installation required!
- [**Serenity/JS Project Templates**](#serenityjs-project-templates) are a good starting point and a reference implementation for your new test automation project
- [**Serenity/JS Modules**](#serenityjs-modules) allow you to customise your project setup, or add Serenity/JS to an existing project
- [**Free GitHub.com account**](#your-githubcom-account) gives you access to Serenity/JS resources, including code repositories, examples and reference implementations, Serenity/JS issue tracker, Serenity/JS Gitpod workspaces, and the Serenity/JS Community Chat.
- [**Your feedback and support**](#your-feedback-matters) will help Serenity/JS to evolve to better meet _your needs_, so get engaged and be part of our community!

## Serenity/JS Gitpods

**Serenity/JS Gitpods** are free virtual workspaces you can launch on demand on [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/).
They are the easiest way to get started with the framework, as every Serenity/JS Gitpod comes with all the **browsers**, **test tools**, **drivers**, **libraries** and even **VisualStudio Code plugins** already installed and ready to go.

In fact, all Serenity/JS tutorials you'll find in this handbook have a corresponding Serenity/JS Gitpod that lets you follow the tutorial without having to install anything on your machine. If you prefer to set up Serenity/JS locally, this handbook will also teach you how to do that.

:::info Short on time? ‚è±Ô∏è
To quickly see what Serenity/JS is capable of, go straight to the first tutorial where you'll learn how to use Serenity/JS and Playwright Test to [write test scenarios for web applications](/handbook/web-testing).
:::

To use Serenity/JS Gitpods, you'll need a [free account on GitHub.com](#your-githubcom-account).
You can then use your GitHub account to sign up for a [free account on Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/) the first time you launch your workspace.

## Serenity/JS Project Templates

Serenity/JS Project Templates are boilerplate repositories that combine the most popular configurations of Serenity/JS modules and include a handful of test scenarios to help you get started.

You can find all the official [Serenity/JS Project Templates on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=template&type=all&language=&sort=).

While you can simply [clone the Serenity/JS Template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your machine,
GitHub.com also allows you to [create _new repositories_ based on Serenity/JS Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
To use this feature, you'll need a [free account on GitHub.com](#your-githubcom-account).

## Serenity/JS Modules

Serenity/JS is a [modular framework](/handbook/about/architecture) based on Node.js, with official modules distributed under the `@serenity-js/*` namespace via [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40serenity-js).
You can use as many or as few of Serenity/JS Modules as you need to enable integrations with required test automation tools and test runners,
interact with the various interfaces of your system under test, and to enable the desired reporting formats.

Each [Serenity/JS module](/api/) typically provides at least one of the following:
- an interface integration library that follows the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern),
- test runner adapters that translate test runner events into [Serenity/JS domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events) (used for [reporting](/handbook/reporting/)),
- [reporting services](/handbook/reporting/) that translate domain events into test reports.

To find out more about how to install a given Serenity/JS module, please consult its [installation instructions](/api/),
as well as the general [Serenity/JS installation guide](/handbook/about/installation).

In general, to use Serenity/JS modules you'll need:
- **Node.js LTS** - a [long-term support version](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) of Node.js;
Serenity/JS is developed on macOS running Node.js <CurrentNodeVersion />
and [continuously tested](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml) with the latest versions of Node <SupportedNodeVersions /> on Linux and Windows,
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**, if you'd like to use the [Serenity BDD reporter](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter),
- a local **web browser** or a remote **Selenium Grid** if you're planning to [interact with web interfaces](/handbook/web-testing/),
- a Node.js project, which you can initialise by running [`npm init ./my-project-name`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init)
