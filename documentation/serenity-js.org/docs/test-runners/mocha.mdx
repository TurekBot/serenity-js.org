# Mocha

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

[Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) is a universal test runner providing a number of useful features,
such as [automatic retry of failed tests](/api/mocha-adapter/interface/MochaConfig).
If your project already uses Mocha to run its unit tests, you can use the same runner for your acceptance tests too.

**You will learn:**
- how to use [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting/), including the [Serenity BDD reporter](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter), even if your test scenarios don't follow the Screenplay Pattern yet
- how to implement Mocha test scenarios using reusable [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) APIs

## Examples and Project Templates

If you'd like to dive straight into the code, [Serenity/JS GitHub repository](https://github.com/serenity-js) provides:
- [Serenity/JS + Mocha project templates](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=mocha+template&type=all&language=&sort=), which are the easiest way to start with the framework,
- several [reference implementations](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples), demonstrating using Serenity/JS with Mocha to write both REST API- and web-based acceptance tests

## Using Serenity/JS reporting services

To use [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting/) in a Mocha project, you need to:
- attach the [`@serenity-js/mocha`](/api/mocha) test runner adapter to Mocha
- [configure Serenity/JS](/api/core/function/configure) to use the reporting services you want to use,
such as the [`ConsoleReporter`](/handbook/reporting/console-reporter)
or [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter)

:::tip Serenity/JS test runner adapters
Serenity/JS test runner adapters turn internal, test runner-specific events
into [Serenity/JS domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events) that can contribute to test execution reports produced
by [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting/).
:::

[`@serenity-js/mocha` module](/api/mocha) provides a [**test runner adapter**](/handbook/about/architecture)
you can attach to your Mocha test runner.

Integration architecture described in this section applies to invoking
`mocha` command line interface directly, for example for **domain-level**,
[**REST/HTTP API-level**](/handbook/api-testing/), or [**web-based testing**](/handbook/web-testing/)
using [Playwright](/api/playwright).

If you want your Mocha scenarios to interact with **web interfaces** using [Selenium Webdriver protocol](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/),
or connect them to a [Selenium Grid](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/),
you should do so via [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor)
or [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio) instead.

### Installing Serenity/JS test runner adapter

Assuming you already have a [Node.js project](/handbook/about/installation#creating-a-nodejs-project)
and [Serenity/JS runtime dependencies](/handbook/about/installation) set up,
add the following Node modules:
- [`@serenity-js/core`](/api/core)
- [`@serenity-js/mocha`](/api/mocha)
- [`mocha`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)

To do that, run the following command in your terminal:
```shell
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/{core,mocha} mocha
```

If you'd like to implement your test suite in TypeScript, also run:
```shell
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/{mocha,node}
```

### Configuring Serenity/JS

If you intend to run your Mocha scenarios using the [Mocha CLI](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage),
the best way to configure Serenity/JS is to invoke the Serenity/JS [`configure`](/api/core/function/configure) function
in a [`beforeAll` hook](https://mochajs.org/#available-root-hooks),
defined in a Mocha support file [`required` upon test execution](https://mochajs.org/#-require-module-r-module):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript project" default>

```typescript title="spec/support/serenity.config.ts"
import 'mocha'

import { configure } from '@serenity-js/core'

beforeAll(async () => {
    // Configure Serenity/JS
    configure({
        crew: [
            '@serenity-js/console-reporter',
            '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
            // ... any other reporting services
        ],
    })
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript project">

```javascript title="spec/support/serenity.config.js"
const { configure } = require('@serenity-js/core')

beforeAll(async () => {
    // Configure Serenity/JS
    configure({
        crew: [
            '@serenity-js/console-reporter',
            '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
            // ... any other reporting services
        ],
    })
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To learn more about installing and configuring Serenity/JS reporting services appropriate for your project,
follow the [Serenity/JS reporting guide](/handbook/reporting/).

### Configuring Mocha

To make sure Mocha loads your Serenity/JS configuration file and correctly interprets TypeScript (if you're using it),
create one of the supported [Mocha configuration files](https://mochajs.org/#configuring-mocha-nodejs) in your project
root directory, e.g. `.mocharc.yml`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript project" default>

```yaml title=".mocharc.yml"
check-leaks: false
full-trace: true
reporter: '@serenity-js/mocha'
require:
  - ts-node/register
  - spec/support/serenity.config.ts
spec: 'spec/**/*.spec.ts'
timeout: 5000
v8-stack-trace-limit: 100
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript project">

```yaml title=".mocharc.yml"
check-leaks: false
full-trace: true
reporter: '@serenity-js/mocha'
require:
  - spec/support/serenity.config.js
spec: 'spec/**/*.spec.js'
timeout: 5000
v8-stack-trace-limit: 100
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Defining Mocha test scenarios

When Serenity/JS reports on Mocha test scenarios, it assumes you're following a common convention
where the outermost [`describe` block](https://mochajs.org/#bdd) describes the name of the feature or component under test,
and any nested `describe` blocks contribute to the name of the test scenario.

For example, Serenity/JS will report the below scenario as:
- feature: `Todo List App`
- scenario: `when the user is a guest their list is empty`

```typescript
import 'mocha'

describe('Todo List App', () => {               // - feature or component name

    describe('when the user is', () => {        // - one or more nested `describe` blocks
        describe('a guest', () => {             //   to group scenarios
            describe('their list', () => {      //   by context in which they apply

                it('is empty', async () => {    // - expected behaviour of the feature or component

                })
            })
        })
    })
})
```

:::tip Feature coverage
Using the same name for the outermost `describe` block in several different spec files makes
Serenity BDD associate the different test scenarios with the same logical "feature" or "component"
and produce [feature coverage metrics](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/the_serenity_reports).

## Using Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern APIs

[Serenity/JS actor model](/api/core/class/Actor) works great with Mocha
and [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) APIs can help your team implement
Mocha test scenarios that are easy to read and understand.

The fastest way to get started with Serenity/JS and Mocha is to use one of
the [Serenity/JS + Mocha project templates](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=mocha+template&type=all&language=&sort=).
However, if you're adding Serenity/JS to an existing project or simply want to understand how the integration works,
this guide is for you.

### Configuring a cast of actors

[Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) is an actor-centred model, so the first thing you
need to do is to tell Serenity/JS what [cast of actors](/api/core/class/Cast) you want to use.

If you're planning to run Mocha scenarios using the [Mocha CLI](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage) **_directly_**,
you can configure the actors in a [`beforeAll`](https://mochajs.org/#available-root-hooks) hook, for example:

```typescript title="spec/support/serenity.config.ts"
import 'mocha'

import { configure, Cast } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from '@serenity-js/playwright'

import * as playwright from 'playwright'

let browser: playwright.Browser;

beforeAll(async () => {

    // Launch the browser once before all the tests
    // Serenity/JS will take care of managing Playwright browser context and browser tabs.
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
        headless: true,
    });

    // Configure Serenity/JS
    configure({
        actors: Cast.where(actor =>
            actor.whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser, {
                baseURL: 'https://todo-app.serenity-js.org/',
            }))
        ),
        crew: [
            '@serenity-js/console-reporter',
            '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
            // ... any other reporting services
        ],
    })
})

afterAll(async () => {
    // Close the browser after all the tests are finished
    await browser?.close()
})
```

Consult the respective test runner instructions if you're invoking Mocha _**indirectly**_,
so via [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor) or [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio).

### Referring to actors in test scenarios

[Serenity/JS actors](/api/core/class/Actor) are often used to represent user personas or important external systems
interacting with the system under test. In those scenarios, a common strategy is to give actors names indicating their persona,
and refer to them in your test scenarios using functions [`actorCalled`](/api/core/function/actorCalled)
and [`actorInTheSpotlight`](/api/core/function/actorInTheSpotlight):

```typescript title="spec/todo-list.spec.ts"
import 'mocha'

import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Navigate, PageElements, By } from '@serenity-js/web'

describe('Todo List App', () => {

    const displayedItems = () =>
        PageElements.located(By.css('.todo-list li'))
            .describedAs('displayed items')

    describe('when the user is', () => {
        describe('a guest', () => {
            describe('their list', () => {

                it('is empty', async () => {
                    await actorCalled('Alice').attemptsTo(
                        Navigate.to('https://todo-app.serenity-js.org/'),
                        Ensure.that(displayedItems().count(), equals(0))
                    )
                })
            })
        })
    })
})
```
