# Debugging

```mdx-code-block
import ArticleComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ArticleComingSoon'
```

<ArticleComingSoon />

Actor receives a chain of activities to perform.
so don't set the breakpoint when the activity is defined,
use the activity to debug.

## Debugging values

how it works

```typescript
Debug.values(...)
```

## Conditional debugging

```typescript
Check.whether(...)
    .andIfSo(Debug.values(...))
```

## Setting breakpoints

```typescript
await actor.attemptsTo()

await actor.attemptsTo()
```


## Using a debugger

See Visual Studio and JetBrains integration guides.
