# Debugging

Serenity/JS helps you model your test scenarios from the perspective of [actors](/api/core/class/Actor) performing [activities](/api/core/class/Activity) to accomplish their goals.
Debugging follows this same consistent approach, with any debug statements expressed using the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug).

The interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) accepts a `debuggerFunction` and any number of arguments, including dynamic values such as [questions](/api/core/class/Question)
and [question adapters](/api/core#QuestionAdapter):

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Debug } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Navigate, Page, PageElement, By } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Debbie').attemptsTo(
    Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
    Debug.values(
        // debuggerFunction:
        (results, url, tagline) => {
            // set a breakpoint anywhere inside the function to view:
            // - `results`, which evaluates to Array<DebuggingResult>
            // - `url`, which evaluates to 'https://serenity-js.org'
            // - `tagline`, which evaluates to text content of the h1 element
        },

        // values to inspect (any number of values, to be evaluated one by one):
        Page.current().url(),
        Text.of(PageElement.located(By.css('h1')).describedAs('tagline'))
    ),
);
```

When the actor reaches the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) in their workflow, the interaction:
- instructs the actor to attempt to resolve provided arguments one by one,
- passes them to your `debuggerFunction` as an array of [`DebuggingResults`](/api/core/interface/DebuggingResult), as well as individual values so that they're easier to inspect and interact with in your debugger,
- makes the actor [collect](/api/core/class/Actor#collect) data artifacts with the results of the evaluation and emit collected artifacts as [domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events)
  to all the registered [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting/) so that they're included in your test reports.

## Error handling

When resolving provided argument results in an error, the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) will still pass,
but the `results` parameter will contain the details of the error so that you can debug it in your IDE:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Debug, Question } from '@serenity-js/core'

const throws = () =>
    Question.about('argument that throws an error', actor => {
        throw new Error('example error')
    })

await actorCalled('Debbie').attemptsTo(
    Debug.values(
        // debuggerFunction:
        (results, value) => {
            // set a breakpoint anywhere inside the function to view:
            // - `value`, which will be `undefined` since resolving it resulted in an error
            // - `results`, which will contain one entry:
            //   [{
            //     description: `argument that throws an error`,    <- description of the Question
            //     value: undefined,
            //     error: Error                                     <- Error thrown during resolution
            //   }]
        },
        throws(),
    ),
);
```

When resolving more than one argument results in an error, `results` array provides details of all the errors.

## Embedding in Tasks

Note that the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) can be embedded in other [tasks](/api/core/class/Task),
to help with debugging nested workflows:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Debug, Task } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Navigate, PageElement, By, Text } from '@serenity-js/web'

const browseSerenityDocs = () =>
    Task.where(`#actor browses Serenity/JS documentation`,
        Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
        Debug.values(
            // debuggerFunction:
            (results, tagline) => {
                // set a breakpoint anywhere inside this function
            },
            Text.of(PageElement.located(By.css('h1')).describedAs('tagline'))
        ),
    )

await actorCalled('Debbie').attemptsTo(
    browseSerenityDocs(),
);
```

## Exploring Playwright locators

[Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)
provides features that allow for [experimenting with web UI locators](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright#tune-locators)
while the test is paused at breakpoint.

Since this functionality is specific to [Playwright](/api/playwright), you can use it by passing [`PlaywrightPage.current().nativePage()`](/api/playwright/class/PlaywrightPage)
as one of the arguments. You must also name the evaluated value `page`, as this is the variable name that the Playwright VSCode extension looks for:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Debug } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { PlaywrightPage } from '@serenity-js/playwright'
import { Navigate } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Debbie').attemptsTo(
    Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
    Debug.values((results, page) => {
        // set a breakpoint here to use Playwright locator debugging features
        page.locator('h1')
        // note that you can change this selector while having the test paused at breakpoint
    }, PlaywrightPage.current().nativePage()),
);
```
