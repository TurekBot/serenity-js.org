# Logging

<ArticleComingSoon />

Don't use `console.log` (explain why it won't work)

Use the interaction to `Log`

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Log } from '@serenity-js/core'

await actorCalled('Logan').attemptTo(
    Log.the('static value')
)
```

Explain what events Log emits

Explain how reporters report the emitted events
