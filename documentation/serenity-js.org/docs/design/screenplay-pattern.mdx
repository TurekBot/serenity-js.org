# Screenplay Pattern

```mdx-code-block
import ArticleComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ArticleComingSoon'
```

Key points:
- **Screenplay Pattern** helps your automated tests focus on business workflows and reduce the complexity of your framework
- **Screenplays** are sequences of _activities_ performed by _actors_ in a test scenario
- **Actors** represent _users_ and _external systems_ interacting with the system under test

From the software design perspective, Serenity/JS _tasks_ are conceptually similar to _procedures_, so _functions_ that don't return a value.
Tasks encapsulate a business-focused sequence of operations that an end-user of our system, or an external system interacting with our system,
would perform to achieve some business outcome. Examples of such tasks include one to `signUp`, `remindPassword`, `findProductByName`, and so on.
