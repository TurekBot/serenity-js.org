# Assertions and expectations

Serenity/JS helps you model your test scenarios from the perspective of [actors](/api/core/class/Actor) performing [activities](/api/core/class/Activity) to accomplish their goals.
Assertions follow this same consistent approach, with any assertions expressed using the interaction to [`Ensure`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure).

The interaction to [`Ensure`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure) has two flavours:
- [`Ensure.that`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure#that), which makes the actor evaluate the expectation, and fails immediately if its condition is not met,
- [`Ensure.eventually`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure#eventually), which keeps evaluating the expectation until the condition is met, or the [interaction timeout](/api/core/class/SerenityConfig#interactionTimeout) expires.

## The anatomy of a Serenity/JS assertion

Both `Ensure.that` and `Ensure.eventually` follow the same consistent pattern and accept two arguments:
- the ["actual value"](http://xunitpatterns.com/ResultVerification.html) - an [`Answerable`](/api/core#Answerable) to be evaluated in the context of the given [actor](/api/core/class/Actor),
- an [`Expectation`](/api/core/class/Expectation) that defines the condition to be met by the actual value.

An example Serenity/JS assertion might look like this:
```typescript
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure, and, startsWith, endsWith } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

await actorCalled('Edna').attemptsTo(
    Ensure.that('Hello world', and(startsWith('Hello'), endsWith('world'))),
    //   actual value --^      ^-- expectation
)
```

Note that several Serenity/JS modules provide expectations you can use to define your assertions, most notably:
- [Serenity/JS assertions module](/api/assertions) provides general use expectations for any type of test automation
- [Serenity/JS web module](/api/web) provides expectations dedicated to automating interactions with web interfaces

## Reusable assertions

Unlike other assertion libraries, Serenity/JS allows for the "actual value" to be [**determined dynamically**](/api/core/class/Question)
and resolved in the context of the actor performing the assertion.
This design enables **great flexibility** and helps to maximise **opportunities for code reuse**.

Consider a simple test scenario, verifying that an [interaction with a REST API](/api/rest) returns
the status code of [200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200):

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi, GetRequest, LastResponse, Send } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

await actorCalled('Apisit')
    .whoCan(CallAnApi.at('https://serenity-js.org/'))
    .attemptsTo(
        Send.a(GetRequest.to('/handbook/design/assertions')),
        Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
    )
```

Since the question about the [`LastResponse.status()`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse#status) is evaluated dynamically
by the actor who performed the [`GetRequest`](/api/rest/class/GetRequest),
you could create a custom [task](/api/core/class/Task) that encapsulates this operation:

```typescript
import { Answerable, d, Task } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { Send, GetRequest, LastResponse } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

const checkUrl = (url: Answerable<string>) =>
    Task.where(d`#actor checks the ${ url }`,
        Send.a(GetRequest.to(url)),
        Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
    )
```

You could then use such custom task to create a simple link checker:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, List } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest'

await actorCalled('Apisit')
    .whoCan(CallAnApi.at('https://serenity-js.org/'))
    .attemptsTo(
        checkUrl('/handbook/design/assertions'),
    )
```
Or even combine it with a [List](/api/core/class/List)
to check multiple URLs one after another:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, List } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest'

await actorCalled('Apisit')
    .whoCan(CallAnApi.at('https://serenity-js.org/'))
    .attemptsTo(
        List.of([
            '/handbook/design/assertions',
            '/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern'
        ]).
        forEach(({ actor, item }) =>
            actor.attemptsTo(
                checkUrl(item),
            ))
    )
```

## Web assertions

Interactions to [`Ensure.that`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure#that) and [`Ensure.eventually`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure#eventually)
are interface-agnostic, so you can use them to verify interactions with [REST APIs](/handbook/api-testing/), [mobile apps](/handbook/mobile-testing/), [web UIs](/handbook/web-testing/), and so on.

Consider the following example web widget:
```html
<h1 class="heading">Hello Serenity!</h1>
```

To interact with such widget, you'd define a [`PageElement`](/api/web/class/PageElement) describing how to locate it:

```typescript
import { PageElement, By } from '@serenity-js/web'

const heading = () =>
    PageElement.located(By.css('.heading'))
```

Since `PageElement` is an implementation of the standard Serenity/JS [`Question`](/api/core/class/Question) interface,
it is accepted by the interaction to `Ensure` just like any other [`Answerable`](/api/core#Answerable) value:

```typescript title="Example web scenario interacting with the widget"
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { isVisible } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Edna').attemptsTo(
    Ensure.that(heading(), isVisible()),
)
```

## Fault-tolerant assertions

What makes web testing challenging is having to deal with **unpredictable delays** typically caused by **network traffic**
or **complex animations**.

To help you work around that, Serenity/JS offers an interaction to [`Ensure.eventually`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure#eventually),
which instead of failing the scenario immediately when the expectation is not met, instructs the actor
to evaluate the actual value until it meets the expectation, or the [interaction timeout](/api/core/class/SerenityConfig#interactionTimeout) expires.

```typescript title="Example web scenario interacting with the widget"
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { isVisible } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Edna').attemptsTo(
    Ensure.eventually(heading(), isVisible()),
)
```

Note that while you can set the global
[interaction timeout](/api/core/class/SerenityConfig#interactionTimeout)
in Serenity/JS configuration, you can also configure it for the specific assertion:

```typescript title="Example web scenario interacting with the widget"
import { actorCalled, Duration } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { isVisible } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Edna').attemptsTo(
    Ensure.eventually(heading(), isVisible())
        .timeoutAfter(Duration.ofMilliseconds(500)),
)
```

## Implementing custom expectations

Serenity/JS [assertions](/api/assertions) and [web](/api/web) modules provide expectations you'll need to implement
even the most sophisticated test scenarios.

However, you can also implement **custom expectations** when needed. To do that, consult the examples in [`Expectation`](/api/core/class/Expectation) API docs
and the [Serenity/JS code base on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js).
