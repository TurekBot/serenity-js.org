# Data structures

```mdx-code-block
import ArticleComingSoon from '@site/src/components/ArticleComingSoon'
```

All the [activities](/api/core/class/Activity) performed by Serenity/JS actors are asynchronous,
and so are the data structures that support them.
Serenity/JS introduces several async-first data structures to support writing test scenarios that follow th [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern).

In this article, I'll show you how the following idiomatic Serenity/JS data structures work and how to use them in your scenarios:
- [`Question`](/api/core/class/Question)
- [`QuestionAdapter`](/api/core#QuestionAdapter)
- [`List`](/api/core/class/List)
- [`Notes`](/api/core/function/notes)
