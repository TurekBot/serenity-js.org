# Console Reporter

```mdx-code-block
import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure'
```

[`ConsoleReporter`](/api/console-reporter/class/ConsoleReporter), available as part of the [`@serenity-js/console-reporter`](/api/console-reporter) module,
writes text-based reports to your computer terminal.

The reporter supports colour schemes for both light and dark terminals, as well as a monochromatic one.

## Installation and usage

To learn about installing and configuring the module, please consult the [`@serenity-js/console-reporter` documentation](/api/console-reporter).

You might also want to explore [Serenity/JS examples on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples).

## Integration

[`ConsoleReporter`](/api/console-reporter/class/ConsoleReporter) listens to [`DomainEvents`](/handbook/reporting/domain-events) emitted by [`Actors`](/api/core/class/Actor) and [Serenity/JS test runner adapters](/handbook/test-runners/).

```mermaid
graph TB
    A(["Actors"])
    TRA(["Serenity/JS test runner adapter"])
    S["Serenity"]
    CR["ConsoleReporter"]
    T["text report"]

    TRA -- notifies --> S
    A -- notify --> S
    S -- notifies --> CR
    CR -- prints --> T

    subgraph "core"
        S
    end
    subgraph "console-reporter"
        CR
    end

    class A socket
    class TRA socket
    click A "/handbook/design/actors.html"
    click S "/modules/core/class/src/Serenity.ts~Serenity.html"
    click CR "/modules/console-reporter"
