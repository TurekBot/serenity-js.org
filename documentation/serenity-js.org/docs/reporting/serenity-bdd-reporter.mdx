# Serenity BDD Reporter

```mdx-code-block
import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure'
```

[Serenity reports](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/the_serenity_reports) are a powerful feature enabled by Serenity BDD. They aim not only to **report test results**, but also to document **how features are tested**, and **what your application does**.
[`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module enables integration between Serenity/JS and the Serenity BDD reporting CLI.

**You will learn:**
- How to install Serenity BDD
- How to configure Serenity BDD reporter
- How to produce Serenity BDD reports

## Examples and Project Templates

If you'd like to dive straight into the code,
[Serenity/JS GitHub repository](https://github.com/serenity-js) provides:
- [Serenity/JS project templates](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=template&type=all&language=&sort=), which are the easiest way to start with the framework
- [Examples and reference implementations](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples), each set up to produce a Serenity BDD report

:::tip Example Serenity BDD reports
All the [Serenity/JS project templates](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=template&type=all&language=&sort=) are configured to produce Serenity BDD reports and publish them to their GitHub Pages.
Each Serenity/JS project template links to its respective Serenity BDD report from its readme file.

For example, here's where [Serenity/JS + Cucumber + Playwright project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template/) publishes its [Serenity BDD reports](https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template/).
:::

## Installation and usage

[Serenity BDD reports](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/the_serenity_reports) are generated by [Serenity BDD CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core/tree/main/serenity-cli),
a Java program downloaded and managed by the [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module.

[`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter) is also available as part of the [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module.
It listens to [domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events) emitted by [actors](/api/core/class/Actor), [test runner adapters](/handbook/test-runners/), and other [stage crew members](/api/core/interface/StageCrewMember),
to produce Serenity BDD-compatible JSON reports, which can be then stored as files to disk  by [`ArtifactArchiver`](/handbook/reporting/artifact-archiver).

Resulting JSON files can be processed by [Serenity BDD CLI](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/) to produce a HTML report and rich living documentation containing screenshots, details of HTTP traffic for any [REST API](/api/rest) interactions,
details of any activities performed by Serenity/JS [actors](/api/core/class/Actor) and more.

### Installation

To add the [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module to your project, run the following command in your computer terminal:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/core @serenity-js/serenity-bdd
```

If you're starting a new project or need a reference implementation,
consider using one of the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/)
as they all come with built-in support for Serenity BDD reporting.

### Configuring the Serenity BDD reporter

To allow Serenity/JS to produce Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports, assign the `SerenityBDDReporter` to the `Stage`
and configure the `ArtifactArchiver` to store the reports at the location where Serenity BDD expects to find them.

This can be done:
- via `playwright.config.ts`, if you're using Serenity/JS with [Playwright Test](/api/playwright-test)
- via `wdio.conf.ts`, if you're using Serenity/JS with [WebdriverIO](/api/playwright-test)
- via `protractor.conf.js`, if you're using Serenity/JS with [Protractor](/api/protractor)
- programmatically, if you're using Serenity/JS with [any other test runner](/handbook/test-runners/)

#### Configuring Playwright Test

```typescript title="playwright.config.ts"
import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
    reporter: [
        [ '@serenity-js/playwright-test', {
            crew: [
                '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
                [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
            ]
        }]
    ],

    // Other configuration omitted for brevity
    // For details, see https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration
}

export default config
```

Learn more about using [Serenity/JS with Playwright Test](/api/playwright-test).

#### Configuring WebdriverIO

```typescript title="wdio.conf.ts"
import { WebdriverIOConfig } from '@serenity-js/webdriverio'

export const config: WebdriverIOConfig = {

    framework: '@serenity-js/webdriverio',

    serenity: {
        crew: [
            '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
        ]
    },

    // Other configuration omitted for brevity
    // For details, see https://webdriver.io/docs/options
}
```

Learn more about using [Serenity/JS with WebdriverIO](/api/webdriverio).

#### Configuring Protractor

```javascript title="protractor.conf.js"
exports.config = {

    framework:      'custom',
    frameworkPath:  require.resolve('@serenity-js/protractor/adapter'),

    serenity: {
        crew: [
            '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
        ]
    },

    // ...
}
```

Learn more about using [Serenity/JS with Protractor](/api/protractor).

#### Overriding default configuration

By default, SerenityBDDReporter tries to [automatically detect](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory)
the root directory of your [requirements hierarchy](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#the-requirements-hierarchy).

If you're using a non-standard directory structure,
you can override the defaults in the [`crew`](/api/core/class/SerenityConfig/#crew) section of your config as follows:

```ts
  crew: [
    [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', { specDirectory: './e2e-specs' } ],
  ]
```

#### Programmatic configuration

```typescript title="serenity.config.ts"
import { ArtifactArchiver, configure } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { SerenityBDDReporter } from '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd'

configure({
    crew: [
        ArtifactArchiver.fromJSON({
            outputDirectory: './target/site/serenity',
        }),
        SerenityBDDReporter.fromJSON({
            specDirectory: './spec',
        })
    ],
})
```

### Using Serenity BDD CLI

To turn the Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports produced by the `SerenityBDDReporter` into Serenity BDD test reports,
you need the [Serenity BDD reporting CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core).

The Serenity BDD reporting CLI is a Java program, distributed as an executable `.jar` file and available to download from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/net.serenity-bdd/serenity-cli).

The `@serenity-js/serenity-bdd` module ships with a command line tool called `serenity-bdd`, where:
- `serenity-bdd update` command downloads the Serenity BDD CLI `jar` and caches it locally
- `serenity-bdd run` command is a wrapper around the Serenity BDD CLI that invokes the Serenity BDD CLI `jar` to produce HTML reports based on the JSON reports generated by the `SerenityBDDReporter`

To learn more about `serenity-bdd`, run the following command in your computer terminal:

```sh
npx serenity-bdd --help
```

To produce Serenity BDD reports, your test suite must:
- call `serenity-bdd update`, typically as part of the `postinstall` or `pretest` [NPM script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-operation-order)
- use the [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter), which produces intermediate Serenity BDD `.json` reports
- call `serenity-bdd run` when the test run completes to generate the aggregated HTML report

The pattern used by all the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) relies
on using:
- a [`postinstall`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-operation-order) NPM script to download the Serenity BDD CLI
- [`npm-failsafe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-failsafe) to run the reporting process even if the test suite itself has failed (which is precisely when you need test reports the most...).
- [`rimraf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf) as a convenience method to remove any test reports left over from the previous run

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "serenity-bdd update",
    "clean": "rimraf target",
    "test": "failsafe clean test:execute test:report",
    "test:execute": "cucumber-js",
    "test:report": "serenity-bdd run"
  }
}
```
Note that in the above code sample, you should configure `test:execute` to invoke your [test runner](/handbook/test-runners/) of choice.

### Downloading Serenity BDD CLI

To download the Serenity BDD reporting CLI or to update it, use the `update` command:

```console
npx serenity-bdd update
```

To download Serenity BDD reporting CLI jar from your company's artifact repository, specify the `--repository` parameter:

```
npx serenity-bdd update --repository https://artifactory.example.org/
```

To learn more about the `update` command, run:

```
npx serenity-bdd --help update
```

Please note that the `update` command will try to download the `.jar` only if you don't have it cached already, or when the one you have is not up to date. Otherwise, no outbound network calls are made.

#### Downloading through a proxy

The `update` command picks up your proxy configuration automatically from your [NPM config](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-config), [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc), or environment variables.
Please note that you only need to use one of those configuration mechanisms.

##### Using NPM config (Linux, macOS, Windows)

To use NPM-level configuration, run the following commands in your terminal:

```console
npm config set proxy http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
npm config set https-proxy http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

If your proxy requires a certificate file, you can provide a path to it as follows:

```console
npm config set cafile /path/to/root-ca.pem
```

The above can also be accomplished by placing an [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc) with following contents in your home directory or your project root:

```bash
# ~/.npmrc
proxy = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
https-proxy = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port

cafile = /path/to/root-ca.pem          # optional
noproxy = localhost,mycompany.com      # optional
```

##### Using environment variables on Linux or macOS

To set your proxy on Linux or macOS, run the following commands in your terminal:

```console
export HTTP_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

If needed, you can also set a `NO_PROXY` variable to a comma-separated list of domains that don't require a proxy, for example:

```console
export NO_PROXY=localhost,mycompany.com
```

Please note that you can add the above commands to your shell's `~/.profile`, so that they're executed whenever you open a new terminal.

##### Using environment variables on Windows

To configure a proxy on Windows, run the following commands in Command Prompt:

```console
set HTTP_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

If you're using Powershell, run the following commands instead:

```console
$env:HTTP_PROXY = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

#### Using a specific User-Agent

If your artifact registry requires you to use a specific user agent, you can configure it using NPM config:

```console
npm config set user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0"
```

#### Ignoring SSL checks

You can instruct the `update` command to ignore any SSL certificate errors by providing an `--ignoreSSL` flag when running the command:

```console
npx serenity-bdd update --ignoreSSL
```

You can also disable certificate checks at the NPM config level by running:

```console
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

Alternative, you can accomplish the same with an `.npmrc` file:

```bash
# ~/.npmrc
npm_config_strict-ssl = false
```

### Configuring Serenity BDD CLI

To configure the [Serenity BDD reporting CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core),
place a file called [`serenity.properties`](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reference/serenity-properties)
in your project root directory. For example:

```properties title="serenity.properties"
serenity.project.name=My awesome project
```

:::tip
Please note that Serenity BDD reporting CLI considers only those properties that are related to producing test reports.
:::


### Running Serenity BDD CLI

To produce the Serenity BDD test report and living documentation using default settings, run:

```
npx serenity-bdd run
```

To learn more about the `run` command and how to change the defaults, run:

```
npx serenity-bdd --help run
```

## Serenity BDD best practices

While Serenity BDD generates great test reports out of the box,
by following a few simple best practices you can turn them into proper [living documentation](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation)
for your product.

In this section, we'll focus on best practices particularly relevant to Serenity/JS users.

### The requirements hierarchy

Organising your specs in a directory hierarchy is a great way to make them easier to navigate and understand.
It also allows Serenity to organise your test reports in a similar way and offer insight into what requirements
were verified at several levels of detail.
This idea is called the "requirements hierarchy" and you can learn more about it
in the [Serenity BDD documentation](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#the-requirements-hierarchy).

#### Requirements hierarchy for Cucumber.js projects

If you're working with Cucumber.js, the root directory of the requirements hierarchy is typically called `features`
and typically contains a flat list of `.feature` files, each representing a feature of your system:

```
features
|- authentication.feature
|- shopping_cart.feature
|- checkout.feature
|- shipping.feature
...
```

While Cucumber.js doesn't recognise or enforce any particular directory structure, Serenity BDD recognises directories
as representing [various levels of the requirements hierarchy](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#common-requirements-structures).
And so, instead of storing all the `.feature` files in a single directory, you can organise them in a directory hierarchy, where each directory
represents a [business capability](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#goals-capabilities-and-features) of your system:

```
features
|- authentication
|  |- google_sign_in.feature
|  |- microsoft_sign_in.feature
|  |- custom_single_sign-on.feature
|  \- README.md
|
|- shopping_cart
|  |- item_management.feature
|  |- save_for_later.feature
|  |- did_you_forget_something.feature
|  \- README.md
|
|- checkout
...
```

Note that in this structure, each directory contains a `README.md` file, which is a great place to document the business capability,
lint to any external documentation, architectural diagrams, and so on. Serenity BDD parses such `README.md` files and includes their contents
in the generated documentation.

For more complex systems, you can also nest the business capability directories further to group related capabilities into themes,
for example:

```
features
|- security
|  |- authentication
|  |  |- google_sign_in.feature
|  |  |- microsoft_sign_in.feature
|  |  |- custom_single_sign-on.feature
|  |  \- README.md
|  |
|  |- audit_trail
|     |- monthly_report.feature
|     |- unexpected_user_activity_alerting.feature
|     \- README.md
...
```

#### Requirements hierarchy for non-Cucumber.js projects

If you're using any other [supported test runner](/handbook/test-runners/), Serenity BDD will still recognise the directory structure
as the requirements hierarchy as long as you:
- name the root directory of your requirements hierarchy `spec`, `tests`, `test` or `features` (or configure the [`specDirectory`](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#overriding-default-configuration) property of the `SerenityBDDReporter` and the `--features` parameter of `serenity-bdd run` command with a different value)
- give your spec files a suffix recognised by Serenity BDD, such as `.spec.ts`, `.e2e.js`, or one of the [other supported file name suffixes](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory)

For example, if you're using [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/),
[Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha/), or [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine/) you might organise your specs as follows:

```
spec
|- security
|  |- authentication
|  |  |- google_sign_in.spec.ts
|  |  |- microsoft_sign_in.spec.ts
|  |  |- custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts
|  |  \- README.md
|  |
|  |- audit_trail
|     |- monthly_report.spec.ts
|     |- unexpected_user_activity_alerting.spec.ts
|     \- README.md
```

### File naming conventions

To help Serenity BDD correctly associate the test results with the right feature, you should keep each feature in a separate spec file,
where the name of the feature is the same as the name of the spec file.

If you're using [Cucumber.js](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/), you might have a `custom_single_sign-on.feature` file
with a matching `Feature` name:

```gherkin title="custom_single_sign-on.feature"
Feature: Custom single sign-on

  As a student
  I want to be able to sign in using my company's single sign-on solution
  So that I don't have to remember yet another password

  Scenario: Signing in with a corporate email address

    Given Alice wants to access her student account details
     When she enters her corporate email address: alice@example.org
      And completes the sign-in process using her corporate credentials
     Then she should be taken to her student account
```

For [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/),
[Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha/) and [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine/) specs,
you might have a `custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts` file where the outermost `describe` block has a matching name:

```typescript title="custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts"
describe('Custom single sign-on', () => {

    it('allows Alice to sign in with a corporate email address', () => {
        // ...
    });
});
```

:::tip How feature name matching works?
Serenity BDD treats spaces and underscores as equivalent and performs a case-insensitive match, so `custom_single_sign-on.feature`,
matches `Custom single sign-on` as well as `Custom Single Sign-On`.
:::

:::warning One feature, one spec file
Try to avoid having multiple top-level `describe` blocks in a single spec file, or `it`/`test` blocks without a `describe` block
as Serenity BDD will not be able to associate the test results with the right feature.
:::

## Integration

`SerenityBDDReporter` emits [`ArtifactGenerated`](/api/core-events/class/ArtifactGenerated) events containing Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports,
which can be stored to disk by [`ArtifactArchiver`](/handbook/reporting/artifact-archiver),
and then turned into Serenity BDD HTML reports by [Serenity BDD Reporting CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core).
