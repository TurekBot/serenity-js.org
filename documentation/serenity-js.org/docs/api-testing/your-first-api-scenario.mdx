# Your first API test scenario

**Serenity/JS** streamlines  designing and implementing test scenarios that interact with REST- and other HTTP-based APIs.
The single, consistent programming model offered by the framework and based on the Serenity/JS [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern)
helps you write **dedicated API test scenarios** or **incorporate API interactions into web-based tests** to enable [Blended Testing](/handbook/api-testing/blended-testing/).

Similarly to other test automation frameworks, you can use Serenity/JS REST to send HTTP requests and verify the responses.
With Serenity/JS, however, both those activities form a natural part of the actor workflow, reuse the same assertions, synchronisation mechanisms, and reporting capabilities
as any other kind of Serenity/JS test scenario. This makes them not only easier to write and maintain, but also to share across test suites, projects, and teams.

Using the same, consistent programming model to write both API and web-based scenarios can be incredibly powerful as it
significantly reduces the cognitive load on your team and unlocks code reuse patterns across your organisation.

To demonstrate how this can be accomplished, in this tutorial I'll show you how to:
- write an API test using Serenity/JS,
- identify reusable sequences of API interactions,
- extract them as _tasks_,
- and apply them in the context of a web-based scenario.

## Writing dedicated API test scenarios

We'll write a simple "health check" test, where an actor sends a HTTP request to check if a web service is up and running.
You can write API test scenarios like this using one of the [Serenity/JS Project Templates for API Testing](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/#resthttp-api-testing),
as they integrate Serenity/JS directly with [Cucumber](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/), [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha/), or [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine/),
without the overhead of managing a web browser.

For our example, we'll use the [GitHub Status API](https://www.githubstatus.com/api)
and make the actor check if a [`GetRequest`](/api/rest/class/GetRequest/) sent to the [status endpoint](https://www.githubstatus.com/api#status)
results in a [`200 OK`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses) response status. Next, we'll check if the JSON body of the response contains a message indicating that all GitHub systems are operational,
and if the status we received from the API is up to date.

```typescript title="spec/github-status.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Mocha (API-only)"}
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { actorCalled, Cast, engage } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi, GetRequest, LastResponse, Send } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { before,describe, it } from 'mocha'

describe('GitHub Status API v2', () => {

    const baseURL = 'https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/'

    before(() => {
        engage(Cast.where(actor =>
            // highlight-next-line
            actor.whoCan(CallAnApi.at(baseURL)))                  // 1) Add ability
        )
    })

    describe('status endpoint', () => {

        it('returns 200 OK when GitHub is up', async () => {

            // highlight-start
            await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
                Send.a(GetRequest.to('status.json')),             // 2) Send request
                Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),  // 3) Verify response
            )
            // highlight-end
        })
    })
})
```

If you've already completed the [Serenity/JS web testing tutorial](/handbook/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/),
the above scenario should look familiar:
1. We start by giving all actors in our [`Cast`](/api/core/class/Cast) abilities to [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi) at a given `baseURL`
2. Next, the actor sends a [`GetRequest`](/api/rest/class/GetRequest) to the `status` endpoint
3. Finally, the actor ensures that the [`LastResponse.status()`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse#status) is [`200 OK`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses)

If all goes well, the scenario passes, and when the assertion fails, Serenity/JS produces a test report showing how the actual response status code differs from the expected one.

If you'd like to follow along with the coding, generate a new project from [Serenity/JS Project Template for Mocha](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-template/generate) and clone it to your machine,
or simply start a new GitPod workspace to experiment with Serenity/JS in your browser!

:::

### Working with JSON responses

Our health check scenario is rather rudimentary at the moment as it only verifies if the service is up and running and received the request.
Let's make it more thorough by verifying that the response body contains a message indicating that all GitHub systems are operational.

As you can see in the [GitHub Status API documentation](https://www.githubstatus.com/api#status),
the `status.indicator` field in the response JSON should have the value of `none` when all systems work as expected, and `minor`, `major`, or `critical` to indicate partial or complete service disruption:

```json title="https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/status.json"
{
  "page":{
    "id":"kctbh9vrtdwd",
    "name":"GitHub",
    "url":"https://www.githubstatus.com",
    "updated_at": "2023-09-29T07:41:15Z"
  },
  "status": {
    "description": "Partial System Outage",
    "indicator": "major"
  }
}
```

With Serenity/JS, you can access the last response body using the [question](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#questions) about [`LastResponse.body<T>()`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse/#body).
You can also access any fields and nested objects in the response body as Serenity/JS
conveniently and automatically wraps them in [`Question`](/api/core/class/Question) objects and makes them available for further assertions.

```typescript title="spec/github-status.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Mocha (API-only)"}
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { actorCalled, Cast, engage } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi, GetRequest, LastResponse, Send } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { before, describe, it } from 'mocha'

describe('GitHub Status API v2', () => {

    // ... Configuration skipped for brevity

    describe('status endpoint', () => {

        it('returns a status indicator of "none" when all GitHub systems are functional', async () => {

            await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
                Send.a(GetRequest.to('status.json')),
                // highlight-start
                Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
                Ensure.that(
                    LastResponse.body().status.indicator,
                    equals('none')
                ),
                // highlight-end
            )
        })
    })
})
```

Note how in the above example you can perform several assertions against the [`LastResponse`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse/)
without having to introduce any additional local variables or helper functions,
and how the code remains readable and easy to understand even to non-technical stakeholders.

### Using question adapters

[`LastResponse`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse/) proxies the underlying `AxiosResponse` object through Serenity/JS [`question adapters`](/api/core#QuestionAdapter) to make it easy to work with in Screenplay Pattern scenarios.
This mechanism lets you access the desired field like `status.indicator` just like you would access a nested property of a regular deserialised JSON object:

```typescript
await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
    Send.a(GetRequest.to('summary.json')),
    // highlight-start
    Ensure.that(
        LastResponse.body().status.indicator,
        equals('none')
    ),
    // highlight-end
)
```

You can use the same mechanism in the context of much more complex responses, too. For example, the data structure
returned by the [`summary` endpoint](https://www.githubstatus.com/api#summary)
contains nested arrays of objects. Here Serenity/JS lets you access not just such nested objects
but also their properties like the [`.length` of an Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length):

```typescript
await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
    Send.a(GetRequest.to('summary.json')),
    // highlight-start
    Ensure.that(
        LastResponse.body().incidents.length,
        equals(0)
    ),
    // highlight-end
)
```

Serenity/JS can even proxy methods exposed by the underlying objects, like [`.toUpperCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase):

```typescript
await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
    Send.a(GetRequest.to('summary.json')),
    // highlight-start
    Ensure.that(
        LastResponse.body().status.indicator.toUpperCase(),
        equals('NONE')
    ),
    // highlight-end
)
```

Properties accessed this way, as well as results of method calls, are automatically wrapped in [`Question`](/api/core/class/Question) objects behind the scenes so that you can avoid unnecessary boilerplate code and noise in your test scenarios.

### Using type-safe assertions

[`LastResponse.body<T>()`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse/#body) supports [TypeScript generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).
This allows you to specify a TypeScript type describing the **structure of the response body** and benefit from type-safe assertions and code completion in your IDE.

For example, the response of the [`status` endpoint](https://www.githubstatus.com/api#status) returns a JSON object with the following structure:

```json title="https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/status.json"
{
  "page":{
    "id":"kctbh9vrtdwd",
    "name":"GitHub",
    "url":"https://www.githubstatus.com",
    "updated_at": "2023-09-28T08:05:39Z"
  },
  "status": {
    "description": "Partial System Outage",
    "indicator": "major"
  }
}
```

Such response could be described using the following TypeScript `StatusJSON` type:

```typescript
interface StatusJSON {
    page: {
        id: string,
        name: string,
        url: string,
        updated_at: string
    };
    status: {
        description: string,
        indicator: 'none' | 'minor' | 'major' | 'critical'
    };
}
```

You can then use the `StatusJSON` type to describe the structure of the response body in your test scenario:

```typescript
await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
    Send.a(GetRequest.to('status.json')),
    Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
    // highlight-next-line
    Ensure.that(LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().status.indicator, equals('none')),
)
```

Using generic types like the one above allows your TypeScript transpiler and your IDE to warn you when your code doesn't match the structure of the response body:

    img={require('@site/static/images/api-testing/your-first-api-scenario/vs-code-type-safe-assertions.png')}
/>

:::tip Full-stack type safety with Serenity/JS
Serenity/JS support for TypeScript generics will benefit you even more when the HTTP APIs of your system under test are also written in TypeScript.
In such case, you can reuse the type definitions from your API codebase in your test scenarios to make sure your tests are always in sync with the API.
:::

### Transforming data types

HTTP APIs operating on JSON data structures use primitive data types like `string` or `number` (or composites thereof) to represent more complex types such as monetary amounts, dates, or timestamps.
While this strategy makes it easier for the API to serialise a complex type and transport it over the HTTP protocol, it also makes it harder for an automated test to work with.
That's because such simplified data representations would need to be deserialised before any meaningful assertions could be performed against them.

For example, how would you check if a timestamp expressed as `"updated_at": "2023-09-29T07:41:15Z"` represented a moment that occurred _within the last 24 hours_?

Thankfully, here too Serenity/JS has you covered as any [`Question`](/api/core/class/Question) can be transformed to another type using the [`Question.as`](/api/core/class/Question/#as) method.

Here, you could transform the `page.updated_at` field of the response body to a [`Timestamp`](/api/core/class/Timestamp/)
and make sure [it's after the current time](/api/assertions/function/isAfter/), less the [duration of 24 hours](/api/core/class/Duration/):

```typescript title="spec/github-status.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Mocha (API-only)"}
import { Ensure, equals, isAfter } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { actorCalled, Cast, engage, Duration, Timestamp } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi, GetRequest, LastResponse, Send } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { before, describe, it } from 'mocha'

describe('GitHub Status API v2', () => {

    // ...

    describe('status endpoint', () => {

        it('returns a status indicator of "none" when all GitHub systems are functional', async () => {

            await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
                Send.a(GetRequest.to('status.json')),

                Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
                Ensure.that(LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().status.indicator, equals('none')),
                // highlight-start
                Ensure.that(
                    LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().page.updated_at.as(Timestamp.fromJSON),
                    isAfter(Timestamp.now().less(Duration.ofHours(24)))
                ),
                // highlight-end
            )
        })
    })
})
```

## Composing interactions into tasks

As you can see, Serenity/JS makes it easy and intuitive to write test scenarios that interact with HTTP-based APIs.
What's even more powerful, however, is that just like with the web-based interactions, API interactions
can also be composed into [tasks](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#tasks).

Conceptually similar to functions, Serenity/JS tasks offer an easy way to associate business domain meaning with sequences of activities
and turn them into reusable building blocks you can share across test suites, projects, and teams.

For example, you could create a `ensureAllSystemsOperational` task function that encapsulated the logic of
ensuring that all GitHub systems are operational.
You could then us it in your test scenario instead of the individual low-level interactions:

```typescript title="spec/github-status.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Mocha (API-only)"}
import { Ensure, equals, isAfter } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { actorCalled, Cast, engage, Duration, Task, Timestamp } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi, GetRequest, LastResponse, Send } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { before, describe, it } from 'mocha'

describe('GitHub Status API v2', () => {

    // ...

    describe('status endpoint', () => {

        // highlight-start
        const ensureAllSystemsOperational = () =>
            Task.where(`#actor ensures all GitHub systems are operational`,
                Send.a(GetRequest.to('status.json')),
                Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
                Ensure.that(LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().status.indicator, equals('none')),
                Ensure.that(
                    LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().page.updated_at.as(Timestamp.fromJSON),
                    isAfter(Timestamp.now().less(Duration.ofHours(24)))
                ),
            )
        // highlight-end

        it('returns a status indicator of "none" when all GitHub systems are functional', async () => {

            await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
                // highlight-next-line
                ensureAllSystemsOperational(),
            )
        })
    })
})
```

Extracting individual interactions into tasks makes your test scenarios more readable and easier to maintain.
It also allows you to reuse the same task in other scenarios.

### API Actions Class Pattern

To take code reusability to the next level, you can extract the task function together with any associated information,
like the interfaces describing the response structure, or information about API endpoint URLs and so on, into a completely separate class.

I called this pattern the **API Actions Class** pattern, and you'll notice that it's conceptually similar to the [Lean Page Objects Pattern](/handbook/web-testing/page-objects-pattern/)
I developed in the context of web UI automation.

API Actions Class pattern is a great way to encapsulate the knowledge about the API and make your test code reusable
not only across test scenarios within a single test suite,
but also across test suites, projects, and teams. After all, an API Actions Class is just a regular TypeScript class.
You could publish it as part of a Node.js module to your organisation's private NPM registry
and share with other teams.


In our example, we could create a `GitHubStatus` class that encapsulated the logic of ensuring that all GitHub systems are operational,
together with the information about the API endpoint URLs and the structure of the response body:

```typescript title="src/GitHubStatus.ts" tab={"label":"GitHubStatus Task"}
import { Ensure, equals, isAfter } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Duration, Task, Timestamp } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { GetRequest, LastResponse, Send } from '@serenity-js/rest'

export class GitHubStatus {
    private static readonly baseURL = 'https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/'
    private static readonly statusJson = `${ GitHubStatus.baseURL }status.json}`

    // highlight-start
    static ensureAllSystemsOperational = () =>
        Task.where(`#actor ensures all GitHub systems are operational`,
            Send.a(GetRequest.to(GitHubStatus.statusJson)),
            Ensure.that(LastResponse.status(), equals(200)),
            Ensure.that(LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().status.indicator, equals('none')),
            Ensure.that(
                LastResponse.body<StatusJSON>().page.updated_at.as(Timestamp.fromJSON),
                isAfter(Timestamp.now().less(Duration.ofHours(24)))
            ),
        )
    // highlight-end
}

interface StatusJSON {
    page: {
        id: string,
        name: string,
        url: string,
        updated_at: string
    };
    status: {
        description: string,
        indicator: 'none' | 'minor' | 'major' | 'critical'
    };
}
```

Note how the information about the API endpoint URLs is `private`, and so it won't leak out of the class and into test scenarios.
Should the API change, you'll only need to update the actions class, and all the test scenarios using it will automatically
start using the new endpoint URLs and data structures.

With an API Actions Class in place, we could then update our test scenario to use the `GitHubStatus` class instead of the task function
we used previously:

```typescript title="spec/github-status.spec.ts" tab={"label":"GitHubStatus Test Scenario"}
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { before, describe, it } from 'mocha'

import { GitHubStatus } from '../src/GitHubStatus'   // highlight-line

describe('GitHub Status API v2', () => {

    // ...

    describe('status endpoint', () => {

        it('returns a status indicator of "none" when all GitHub systems are functional', async () => {

            await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
                // highlight-next-line
                GitHubStatus.ensureAllSystemsOperational(),
            )
        })
    })
})
```

## Reusing API interactions in web-based scenarios

The advantage of **encapsulating API interactions in tasks** and organising them into **API Actions Classes**
is that it makes your code easy to reuse in other test scenarios.
The beauty of the Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern is that the universal programming model it enables
allows you to reuse such test code in other test scenarios within the same test suite and in entirely different contexts.


A popular use case is to **reuse API interactions in web-based scenarios** to perform **health checks**, **authentication**,
or **test data setup and teardown** operations that would be much more expensive to achieve through the web UI.
I call this approach [**Blended Testing**](/handbook/api-testing/blended-testing/).

To support you in using Blended Testing in your test suites,
all [Serenity/JS web test runner adapters](/handbook/test-runners/)
and [Serenity/JS Project Templates for Web Testing](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/#web-testing) come with **built-in support for REST and HTTP-based interactions**,
so there's no need to install additional dependencies or manually configure anything.


For example, you could instruct your Serenity/JS actors to use our `GitHubStatus` API Actions Class
in a web-based scenario by simply giving them an API task to perform:

```typescript title="e2e/github-sponsors.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it, test } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
import { Ensure, startsWith } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'

import { GitHubStatus } from '../src/GitHubStatus'

describe('GitHub', () => {

    // Set the baseURL directly in the test or in playwright.config.ts
    //
    // Note that Serenity/JS Playwright Test adapter configures the cast of actors for you
    // and ensures that each actor receives the ability to CallAnApi.at(baseURL)
    test.use({
        baseURL: 'https://github.com/'
    })

    describe('Sponsors', () => {

        it('lets developers support Serenity/JS', async ({ actor }) => {

            await actor.attemptsTo(
                // highlight-start
                // Use the status API to ensure system is ready to be tested
                GitHubStatus.ensureAllSystemsOperational(),

                // Perform any web-based interactions
                Navigate.to('/sponsors/serenity-js'),
                Ensure.that(
                    Page.current().title(),
                    startsWith('Sponsor @serenity-js on GitHub Sponsors')
                ),
                // highlight-end
                // ...
            )
        })
    })
})
```

```typescript title="e2e/github-sponsors.spec.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO"}
import { describe, it } from 'mocha'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure, startsWith } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'

import { GitHubStatus } from '../src/GitHubStatus'

describe('GitHub', () => {

    // Set the baseUrl in wdio.conf.ts, for example:
    //
    //   baseUrl: 'https://github.com/'
    //
    // Note that Serenity/JS WebdriverIO adapter configures the cast of actors for you
    // and ensures that each actor receives the ability to CallAnApi.at(baseUrl)

    describe('Sponsors', () => {

        it('lets developers support Serenity/JS', async () => {

            await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
                // highlight-start
                // Use the status API to ensure system is ready to be tested
                GitHubStatus.ensureAllSystemsOperational(),

                // Perform any web-based interactions
                Navigate.to('/sponsors/serenity-js'),
                Ensure.that(
                    Page.current().title(),
                    startsWith('Sponsor @serenity-js on GitHub Sponsors')
                ),
                // highlight-end
                // ...
            )
        })
    })
})
```

```typescript title="e2e/github-sponsors.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Protractor"}
import { describe, it } from 'mocha'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure, startsWith } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'

import { GitHubStatus } from '../src/GitHubStatus'

describe('GitHub', () => {

    // Set the baseUrl in protractor.conf.js, for example:
    //
    //   baseUrl: 'https://github.com/'
    //
    // Note that Serenity/JS Protractor adapter configures the cast of actors for you
    // and ensures that each actor receives the ability to CallAnApi.at(baseUrl)

    describe('Sponsors', () => {

        it('lets developers support Serenity/JS', async () => {

## Using Serenity/JS REST testing templates

Use [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) to create a new GitHub repository for your automation project in seconds.

Remember that each Serenity/JS template comes with a [GitPod workspace](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/#serenityjs-gitpods) that uses a dedicated Docker image with all the required dependencies
and comes with pre-configured VisualStudio Code extensions to help you experiment with running Serenity/JS straight away in your browser with no local installation required.
