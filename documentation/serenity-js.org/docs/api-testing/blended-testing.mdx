# Blended Testing

**Blended Testing** means making test scenarios interact with **multiple interfaces** of the system under test
to improve their **stability**, **reliability**, and **performance**
without reducing their **coverage**.

Learning to blend UI and API interactions in a single test scenario will allow you to speed up your tests by using API interactions
to perform tasks such as test data setup and teardown, API health checks, automating user account creation and more!
