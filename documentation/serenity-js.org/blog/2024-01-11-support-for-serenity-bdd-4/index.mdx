[**Serenity/JS 3.15.0**](/changelog/3.15.0) introduces support for **Serenity BDD 4** and aggregated test reports for Playwright Test, WebdriverIO, Mocha, Jasmine and Cucumber! ðŸ¥³

We've also updated the Serenity/JS Handbook to help you get the most out of the new Serenity/JS and Serenity BDD reporting features - check out:
- [Reporting > Serenity BDD Reporter](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/)
- [Serenity BDD best practices](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#serenity-bdd-best-practices) (NEW!)

### Important changes

If you're still using the Serenity/JS 2-style syntax for registering the `SerenityBDDReporter`, you'll need to update your configuration file to use the Serenity/JS 3 convention:

```diff
- import { ArtifactArchiver } from '@serenity-js/core';
- import { SerenityBDDReporter } from '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd';

// ...
    crew: [
-     new SerenityBDDReporter(),
-     ArtifactArchiver.storingArtifactsAt('./target/site/serenity'),
+     '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
+     [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', {
+       outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity'
+     } ],
    ]
// ...
```
