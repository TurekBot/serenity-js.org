# Web testing

[**Serenity/JS web module**](/api/web) is an abstraction layer on top of popular web integration tools like [WebdriverIO](/api/webdriverio), [Playwright](/api/playwright), or [Protractor](/api/protractor).
It helps you create **portable test code libraries** that interact with web-based interfaces and can be shared and reused across projects and teams.

To help you achieve this flexibility, Serenity/JS web module offers several key features:
- [**Portable interaction APIs**](/api/web) - a library of [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern)-compatible _interactions_, _questions_, and _models_ that work the same way across all the supported web integration tools,
- [**Page Element Query Language**](/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language) - a portable, composable, and type-safe abstraction around low-level tool-specific selectors,
- [**Web assertions**](/handbook/design/assertions#web-assertions) and [**synchronisation**](/handbook/design/waiting-and-synchronisation) - a library of _expectations_ to help you implement web-first assertions, as well as conditional logic and synchronisation using the same consistent pattern.

The best way to experience working with the Serenity/JS web module is by using it, which is what I'm going to show you next!
