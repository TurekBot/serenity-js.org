# API testing with Serenity/JS

[**Serenity/JS REST**](/api/rest) is a [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern)-compatible library that enables your actors to interact with REST- and other
HTTP-based interfaces. Under the hood, Serenity/JS REST uses the popular [Axios HTTP client](https://github.com/axios/axios), allowing you to leverage its [plugin ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:axios),
and adds automatic proxy server detection to ensure your API tests work smoothly, even in corporate networks.

In this chapter, you'll learn about:
- [**Interacting with HTTP APIs**](/handbook/api-testing/your-first-api-scenario/) using Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern libraries
- [**Configuring Serenity/JS HTTP client**](/handbook/api-testing/configuring-http-client/) for API testing
- [**Sending HTTP requests**](/handbook/api-testing/sending-requests/) using the Serenity/JS REST module
- [**Verifying HTTP responses**](/handbook/api-testing/verifying-responses/) using the Serenity/JS assertions module
- [**Blended Testing**](/handbook/api-testing/blended-testing/) and writing business-focused API test scenarios
