# Logging

Serenity/JS helps you model your test scenarios from the perspective of [actors](/api/core/class/Actor) performing [activities](/api/core/class/Activity) to accomplish their goals.
Logging follows this same consistent approach, with any log statements expressed using the interaction to [`Log`](/api/core/class/Log).

The interaction to [`Log`](/api/core/class/Log) accepts any number of arguments, including dynamic values such as [questions](/api/core/class/Question)
and [question adapters](/api/core#QuestionAdapter):

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Log } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Page } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Laura').attemptsTo(
  Log.the('Current page', Page.current().title(), Page.current().url().href),
  //  static value --^        question --^          question adapter --^
)
```

When the actor reaches the interaction to [`Log`](/api/core/class/Log) in their workflow, the interaction:
- evaluates the arguments in the context of the given actor,
- makes the actor [collect](/api/core/class/Actor#collect) data artifacts with the results of the evaluation,
- the actor emits collected artifacts as [domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events),
- domain events are announced to all the registered [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting/).

Since the interaction to `Log` relies on Serenity/JS domain events to propagate the information,
all the registered reporting services receive the exact same information and can include it in their respective reports.
