# Getting started

Serenity/JS is a full-stack acceptance testing framework. Its modular design enables you to create test scenarios
**_interacting with any interface of your system_** while reducing the number of dependencies you need.

:::info Get started fast
To get a feel for the Serenity/JS, [follow our 15-minute web testing tutorial](/handbook/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/) üöÄ
:::

In this chapter, I'll give you a high-level **overview of the framework** and you'll learn about:
- [**Serenity/JS Project Templates**](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) - a great starting point and a reference implementation for your new test automation project
- [**Serenity/JS Installation**](/handbook/getting-started/installation/) - for when you're ready to set up Serenity/JS locally or need to tweak the defaults
- [**Serenity/JS Architecture**](/handbook/getting-started/architecture/) - a deeper dive into how Serenity/JS works and its philosophy
- [**Serenity/JS Versioning Strategy**](/handbook/getting-started/versioning/) - or why it's safe to stay up to date with the latest features and patches

## Modernising existing projects

With Serenity/JS you don't need to start from scratch! The framework is designed to help
you **safely** and **progressively modernise existing codebases**!

In the second part of this chapter, I'll show you **how to add Serenity/JS** to an existing automation project and you'll learn about:
- [**Using Serenity/JS with Playwright Test**](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-playwright-test/)
- [**Using Serenity/JS with Protractor**](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-protractor/)
- [**Using Serenity/JS with WebdriverIO**](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-webdriverio/)

## Upgrading from Serenity/JS 2

If you're using Serenity/JS 2, the [Serenity/JS 3 upgrade guide](/handbook/getting-started/upgrading-to-serenity-js-3/)
will help you update your tests to benefit from all the latest features.
